Speech enhancement analysis and development with Scilab
=======================================================

This development area contains Scilab scripts and audio files used to analyse and develop the speech
enhancement unit for Magnus.

This is used basically as a means of communication between the author and his thesis advisor.
Despite of it, it may contain interesting information in the field of speech enhancement and signal processing
in general. This is why it has been freed on the Internet under the same licence as for Magnus, the
GPLv3.

Please don't expect a typical project folder organization for this area, it is not so. Only the licence
text COPYING and this README file have been included and produced to make all the code freely available for
anyone who wishes to see bowels of this processing unit.

In the hope that this is most useful to the reader, kind regards.
