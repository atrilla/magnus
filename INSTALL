Magnus: Mouse Advanced GNU Speech
=================================

In order to get Magnus running, the first step is obtaining
the binary compiled files (bytecodes) of the project 
distribution.

There are three ways to run Magnus on a computer: through
the compilation of the source files available in the
source package (1), through the direct execution of the
precompiled bytecodes available in the binary package (2)
and directy from a Java Web Start prepared application (3).


*****
(1) magnus-<version>-src.tar.gz

This package contains the source files of the project. It is
intended for developers who wish to improve Magnus or use
it for any application they may need or want.

Magnus has been developed under Linkat, which is the
GNU/Linux distribution for the Catalan educational system,
promoted by The Ministry of Education of Catalonia.
Its functionality has been thoroughly tested under this
platform, a very important aspect to take care of
when it comes to develoment environments. Despite of it,
Magnus should be appropiate for any other GNU/Linux
distribution, if the user intends to develop upon it.
If not, almost any other platform with a Java Virtual
Machine equal or newer than the 1.5 release should be
able to run it.

Once this tarball is downloaded, it must be uncompressed
with

   tar -xvzf magnus<version>-src.tar.gz

The process should end with the creation of a folder named
"magnus" which contains the source files of the project.

Once in the folder, the Apache Ant builder will be in charge
of the compilation process just by typing

   ant

And finally, under the same root folder

   ant run

and Magnus should successfully be launched.


*****
(2) magnus-<version>-bin.tar.gz

This package contains the binary distribution under a
tarball file which must be uncompressed in the same way
as described in (1). Then, in the folder produced by
this process, just by typing

   java -jar -Xmx500m Magnus-<version>.jar

the program should be launched successfully.

(3) Magnus.jnlp

This file makes easy the hole process from the obtention
to the execution. It can be placed in a website. Up to date
it can be linked from the blog of the project available at

   magnusproject.wordpress.com

Java Web Start checks that the users have the latest release,
downloading it automatically in case they don't have it, and
launching the program afterwards. 

This file states what files are needed by the application,
which are its dependancies, and resolves the process
automatically. In the author's Master Thesis
the preparation of this file is explained in detail.
